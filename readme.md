# Patatap Clone

This was the final project in the Front End section of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.  It is a clone of the patatap application.  The majority of the project was learning how to integrate and work with an external JS library, in this case I used Paper.js and Howler.js.  I'll definitely be revisiting those libraries in the future.
